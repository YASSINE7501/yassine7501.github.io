My project, my resume, is a dynamic website, so I can't host it on GitHub. Instead, I'll need to utilize Live Serveur in Visual Studio and then activate 'Go live' to access the dynamic site'.Otherwise, the images won't be visible in the Github link. 
It's a pratical HTML and CSS code, incorporating the use of flex as requested by the instructor.
